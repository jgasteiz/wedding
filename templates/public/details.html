            {% blocktrans %}Traditionally, Polish weddings start with a traditional chicken soup. Nowadays it's not necessarily to have it, but I'm all up for traditions. After that, you should expect around 4 or 5 main dishes of meat and salads every couple of hours. These dishes will be served between 5pm and 2am, being the last one a delicious beetroot soup with dumplings – a very traditional one too.{% endblocktrans %}

        </p>
        <p>
            {% blocktrans %}Of course, you can mix the vodka with anything you like, but you'll see the most of the locals drinking it in shots. And I encourage you to try the same. We're personally making sure we're getting one of the best – if not the best – Polish vodkas, so people can drink it without worrying too much about the next morning. Our only advice would be to take it easy if you're planning to drink other alcohols, everyone knows what happens when you mix too much right?{% endblocktrans %}
